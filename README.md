If youre looking here i imagine you know how to mod consoles so i wont go through the how to.

this system doesnt connect expansion audio, so i added through hole pins for pin 45 and 46 so that you can easily re-enable it. 

i havent tested this. but it should work. measurements are "super close". it may need a need shaving. unless its super off im not going to update this design. 

feel free to use the library. it is a full famicome cart connector library for eagle that i made.
